# The Truly Terrific Tabletop Thing (a.k.a 6T)

(Build status pending.)

6T is an open-source server and desktop client for playing arbitrary tabletop roleplaying games, like D&D or Shadowrun. It:

* Performs well on low-end hardware.
* Has a pleasant user interface for players and gamemasters.
* Is designed to make turns resolve smoothly and efficiently.
* Runs on all major desktop operating systems.
* Doesn't lock features behind paywalls.
